# PHP Challenge

This collection of code is intended to demonstrate capabilities in response to the challenge posed in VENDITAN OOP PHP PC.pdf

## Notes and assumptions

* code has been developed in PHP7.3
* 1:1 relation between consignment and order
* consignment number calculations don't include math
    * consignment numbers are based on order and batch details

## Project scenario 

solution in OOPHP 

* start batch
* add orders
* generate consignment numbers
* finish batch
* generate consignment list for each courier

## Mock data

it's easier to see working code with some sample data, so there are a few csv files included
