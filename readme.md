# PHP Challenge

This collection of code is intended to demonstrate capabilities in response to the challenge posed in VENDITAN OOP PHP PC.pdf

## Notes and assumptions

* code has been developed in PHP7.3
* 1:1 relation between consignment and order

## Project scenario 

solution in OOPHP 

* start batch
* add orders
* generate consignment numbers
* finish batch
* generate consignment list for each courier

## Mock data

it's easier to see working code with some sample data, so there are a few csv files included

## Out of scope

As noted in the challenge, the following areas have not been handled

* Manipulation of existing data
* Localisation - VAT, translations, number systems, currencies
* Authentication, security (oauth, https, csrf, etc), interaction
* Full test coverage, logging, error handling (unit testing, set up for integration with loggers etc)
* Deployment (env, platform, CI/CD scripts)
